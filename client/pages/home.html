     <h3 id="page1" style=""><img id="i" src="client/img/i.png">n ancient times, all around the world, self-cultivation was a part of normal, everyday life.  People practiced improving their whole selves - their moral character and their virtues.  This was practiced in the East and in the West, and it could be found in all trades and in all professions.  Even thieves had codes of conduct they lived by.  Professional cultivators - monks and nuns (those who practiced full-time) - could be found in the major world religions, for religions, too, adhered to this practice.  Outside of religions, there were many other cultivation ways, including many types of qigong, tai chi, yoga, and various solitary, individual practices.<br><br>

      Each cultivation practice had its own unique system.  Some involved exercises, some involved meditation, and others involved only faith, worship, and prayer.  But, no matter how different they all were from each other, they all revolved around the same one thing - the improvement of one's moral character - bit by bit, all the way up until Perfection.  Then, one could go to Heaven.<br><br>
